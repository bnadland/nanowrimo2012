This is my entry for the NaNoWriMo 2012.

Between work and social life, I dont really have time
for this and registered/started spontanously a couple
of days into November, so I probably won't get to the
targeted 50K words or anywhere near it.

The story is based in a world I am building as a Setting
for the Pathfinder RPG System.
I also plan to have Charactersheets ready for the main
characters and try not to break the rules during the narrative.
