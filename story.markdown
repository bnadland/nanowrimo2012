Gorza panted. She had tracked the beast for four days through the thickest woods
she had seen so far. She felt the hunt coming to an end for better or worse.

A movement in the edge of her vision spun her around readying her bow. A couple of meters
away was the red-eyed, dirt-stained boar. With his tusked head raised he was nearly as high
as her shoulder.

She let the arrow fly in a quick movement and dropped the bow. Unsheathing the sword on her hip,
she watched the projectile pierce his neck.

Now bleeding, the boar was furious and charged at her with his head lowered and his tusks dangerously glimming
in the evening twilight. She jumped. Landed on her side and thrust her steel in the direction of the running beast.

The sword jerked from her hand when it connected with the head. The beast howled. She staggered to a low stand and drew
her dagger from its ankle sheath.
