# System

## Design Goals:

* mostly d20 based (with d6 and maybe other dice aswell)
* D&D like saturation with magical items
* streamlined equipment and resource managements
* tactical fights without minis
* flexible, balanced magic system
* classless
* simple tracking of fights (no status/conditions/... effects)
* quick, randomizable way to generate monster and NPCs
* different energy and damage sources for resistances and attacks

## Character

A character is defined by the following crunch:

* Healthpoints (invested Heropoints x 5)
* Chaospoints (invested Heropoints)
* Skills
* Feats
* Flaws
* Loadout (equipment on your character, always available)
* Equipment (equipment in your backpack, ...)

### Skills

* [Resistance] (physical/fire/... think Armor Class for Special Abilities and Spells)
* Toughness (=> Healthpoints?)
* Will/Discipline (=> Chaospoints?)
* Defense/Parrying (think Armor Class?)
* Stealth
* Athletics
* Knowledge
* Diplomacy (combat like system for this?)
* Alchemy (item creation)
* Profession (catchall for background story related abilities, that are not handled by other skills)
* [Weapontype] (Sword, Axe, Hammer, Bow, Spear, ...)
* Cure (healing, curing)
* [Magictype] (Summon, Shadow, ...)

### Feats

Feats only improve abilities they dont give additional tactical options (negative examples: weapon finesse, power attack)

### Flaws

Flaws give the the player additional Heropoints during character generation and the Gamemaster has additional hooks
to add plots to the story. (Examples: Enemy, Mentor, ...)

## Setting

Orcs/Elves/Humans/Dwarfs are considered different cultures.

### Magic/Chaos

Limits of Magic are:

* no time travel
* no divination

#### Spells/Powers

You expend Chaos Points to use these.

Note: Look into the Universal Monster Rules for inspiration

Examples I want to see:

* Push/Pull/Telekinesis
* Fireball
* Lightning
* Barriers
* Berserker Rage
* Invisibility/Camouflage
* Sneak Attack (?)

The list of spell should be a range of examples generated from abstract rules that are included
to generate own spells and powers.

#### Additional Concepts

* Rituals
* Item creation
* Research

## Gameplay

Basic roll: 1d20+Skill against DC

### Combat

You roll Initiative for each participant (d20 + Boni).

Each turn you have 1 Move and 1 Action.

20 is an automatic success (and critical hit?).
1 is a botch. (For ranged weapons this means out of ammo for this encounter.)

Move:

* Move (up to 5m)

Action:

* another Move Action
* Attack (Skill:[Weapontype] + d20 + Boni against Defense of Enemy)
* Power (Skill:[Magictype] + d20 + Boni against Resistance of Enemy)

## Hazards

Poisoning cost you Chaos Points

## Advancement

Each encounter earns between 1-3 Heropoints. These are summed and
given by the Gamemaster when the party has downtime (say in towns
between sessions).

These Heropoints are used to buy Skillpoints and additional Feats.

## Equipment

Each character gets Resource Points that are an abstract way of handling money
during gameplay.

* Weapons (Damage and Maneuverboni: Small (1d6), Medium (2d6), Large (3d6); Damage Type: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing)
* Armor (integrate into talismans?)
* Potions (one time use) (most Potions poison you, aka cost you Chaos Points)
* Talismans (reuseable) (reduce your maximum chaos points)
