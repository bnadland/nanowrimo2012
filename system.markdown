# System

## Design Goals:

* mostly d20 based (with d6,d10 and maybe other dice aswell)
* D&D like saturation with magical items
* streamlined equipment and resource managements
* tactical fights without minis
* flexible, balanced magic system
* classless
* simple tracking of fights (no status/conditions/... effects)
* quick, randomizable way to generate monster and NPCs
* different energy and damage sources for resistances and attacks

## Character

* Health Points (invested Heropoints x 5)
* Chaos Points (invested Heropoints)
* Skills
* Feats
* Flaws

### Skills

* Resistances (physical/fire/...)
* Toughness
* Will/Discipline
* Defense/Parrying (think Armor Class)
* Stealth
* Athletics
* Knowledge
* Diplomacy
* Alchemy/Craft (item creation)
* Sword
* Axe
* Hammer
* Bow
* Spear
* Cure (healing, curing)
* Summon
* Shadow (Invisibility)

### Feats

Feats only improve abilities they dont give additional tactical options (negative example: weapon finesse, power attack)

### Flaws

Flaws give the the player additional Heropoints during character generation and the Gamemaster has additional hooks
to add plots to the story.

## Setting

Orcs/Elves/Humans/Dwarfs are considered different cultures.

### Magic/Chaos

Limits of Magic are:

* no time travel
* no divination

#### Powers

You expend Chaos Points to use these.

Note: Look into the Universal Monster Rules

Examples I want to see:

* Push/Pull/Telekinesis
* Fireball
* Lightning
* Barriers
* Berserker Rage
* Invisibility

The spelllist should be a range of examples generated from abstract rules that are included
to generate own spells.

#### Additional Concepts

* Rituals
* Item creation
* Research

## Gameplay

Basic roll: 1d20+Skill against DC

### Combat

20 is an automatic success (and critical hit?).
1 is a botch. (For ranged weapons this means out of ammo for this encounter.)

## Hazards

Poisoning cost you Chaos Points

## Advancement

Each encounter earns between 1-3 Heropoints. These are summed and
given by the Gamemaster when the party has downtime (say in towns
between sessions).

These Heropoints are used to buy Skillpoints and additional Feats.

## Equipment

* Weapons (Damage and Maneuverboni: Small (1d6), Medium (1d10), Large (2d6); Damage Type: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing)
* Armor (integrate into talismans?)
* Potions (one time use) (most Potions poison you, aka cost you Chaos Points)
* Talismans (reuseable) (reduce your maximum chaos points)
