# System

## Design Goals:

* mostly d20 based (with d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d100 sprinkled inbetween)
* D&D like saturation with magical items
* streamlined equipment and resource managements
* tactical fights without minis
* flexible, balanced magic system
* classless
* simple tracking of fights (no status/conditions/... effects)

## Character

* Health Points
* Chaos Points
* Skills
* Feats
* Flaws

## Skills

* Resistances (physical/fire/...)
* Toughness
* Will/Discipline
* Defense/Parrying (think Armor Class)
* Stealth
* Athletics
* Knowledge
* Diplomacy
* Alchemy/Craft (item creation)
* Sword
* Axe
* Hammer
* Bow
* Spear
* Cure (healing, curing)
* Summon
* Shadow (Invisibility)

## Setting

Orcs/Elves/Humans/Dwarfs are considered different cultures.

### Magic/Chaos

Limits of Magic are:

* no time travel
* no divination

#### Powers

You expend Chaos Points to use these.

Examples I want to see:

* Push/Pull/Telekinesis
* Fireball
* Lightning
* Barriers
* Berserker Rage
* Invisibility

The spelllist should be a range of examples generated from abstract rules that are included
to generate own spells.

#### Rituals

* A way to reduce chaos points ?
* Healing

#### Item creation

## Gameplay

1d20+Skill >= DC

The only way to heal chaos points is to rest, no herbs, magic, etc.

## Hazards

Poisoning cost you Chaos Points

## Advancement

Each encounter earns between 1-3 Heropoints. These are summed and
given by the Gamemaster when the party has downtime (say in towns
between sessions).

These Heropoints are used to buy Skillupgrades and new Feats.

## Equipment

* Weapons
* Armor (integrate into talismans?)
* Potions (one time use) (most Potions poison you, aka cost you Chaos Points)
* Talismans (reuseable) (reduce your maximum chaos points)
