h1. System

h2. Design Goals:

* d20 based (with d6 and maybe other dice aswell)
* D&D like saturation with magical items
* streamlined equipment and resource managements
* tactical fights without minis
* flexible, balanced magic system
* classless
* simple tracking of fights (minimal status/conditions/... effects)
* quick, randomizable way to generate monster and NPCs
* different energy and damage sources for resistances and attacks

h2. Character

A character is defined by the following crunch:

* Healthpoints
* Chaospoints
* Skills
* Feats
* Flaws
* Equipment (equipment on your character, available with one standard action for drawing it) (5 Slots, +1 (10 Heropoints))
* Items (equipment in your backpack, ...)

h3. Creation

20 Healthpoints
10 Chaospoints
20 Skillpoints
1 Feat
1 Power
1 Flaw
10 Resourcepoints for Equipment and Items

h3. Skills

* Resistance[Type] (physical/fire/... think Armor Class for Attacks, Special Abilities and Spells)
* Stealth (Sneaking, Hiding, ...)
* Security (Lockpicking, Disabling Devices, ...)
* Athletics
* Knowledge
* Culture[Type] (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc) (works as Diplomacy and Knowledge regarding this culture)
* Alchemy (item creation)
* Profession[Type?] (catchall for background story related abilities, that are not handled by other skills)
* Weapon[Type] (Blunt, Piercing, Edged, Ranged)
* Cure (healing, curing)
* Magic[Type] (Summon, Shadow, ...)

h3. Feats

Feats only improve abilities they dont give additional tactical options (negative examples: weapon finesse, power attack)

* Sneak Attack (improves the damage output in cases of combat advantage (+d6 per feat level))

h3. Flaws

Flaws have negative and positive effects and provide the Gamemaster with potential plot hooks.
(Enemies, Mentor, Organizational ties, ...)

h2. Setting

Orcs/Elves/Humans/Dwarfs are considered different cultures.

h3. Orc

see Atayal on wikipedia

h3. Magic/Chaos

Limits of Magic are:

* no time travel
* no divination

h4. Spells/Powers

You expend Chaos Points to use these.

Note: Look into the Universal Monster Rules for inspiration

Examples I want to see:

* Push/Pull/Telekinesis
* Fireball
* Lightning
* Barriers
* Berserker Rage
* Invisibility/Camouflage
* Shapeshifting

The list of spell should be a range of examples generated from abstract rules that are included
to generate own spells and powers.

h4. Additional Concepts

* Rituals
* Item creation
* Research

h2. Gameplay

Basic roll: 1d20+Skill against DC

h3. Combat

You roll Initiative for each participant (d20 + Boni).

20 is an automatic success (and critical hit?).
1 is a botch.

Each turn you have 1 Move action and 1 Combat action.

h2. Advancement

Each encounter earns between 1-3 XP. These are summed and
